# 2. Introduction to Visual Thinking

What is **Visual Thinking**?

> Visual Thinking is the ability that everyone has to connect ideas, emotions and senses at the same time through the drawing. Even before writing, humans developed drawing skills many years ago, because the act of drawing connects many things to understand the world behind us. Sometimes formal education prioritised other ways to communicate (writing, public speaking, etc.), and people used to think drawing it‚Äôs only a skill for artists. Visual Thinking  is this ability to communicate to each other through visuals.

The Chauvet caves in France the humans from more than 35 000 years ago drew the first drawings. We have the drawing skills in our genes!

Visual Thinking is the ability to connect with other parts of you and improve your way to understand the world behind you.
