  ## Resume 
  > What do you feel about drawing your sensations about this songs? The first one it's a famous song from Psicosis, a popular film, while the second song it's more emotive and happy. What are the diffence between both exercises?
  
  Takeaways 🏆:
  - For this activity you should close your eyes, because you need to work with your other senses like the active listening and the drawing by your hands. 
  - The scribbles are just a visualization of how you're feeling the music. Music allow us to connect better with emotions. We need to develop this connection.
  - What about practice this during a meeting? Could you visualize your emotions?

  ## Resume 
  > Visual Thinking it's practical, so we need to develop this skill and this activity it's about that. Although the first part is about think in all the words with the letter, the hard part comes when you have to draw that words, but in that short time you should be able to start to connect quickly meanings with drawings, that's the skill that we need! I recommend you practice this many times as possible.  
  
  Takeaways 🏆:
  - How easy or hard it's drawing practical icons? Sometimes it's hard find references about icons, I recomment you find your words here: [Flaticon Icons](https://www.flaticon.es/)
  - Using timers involve another kind of complexity, but we're learninig and we need this just to show to us how we're working in a short period of time. This could give us better metrics about our progress. 
  - Remember, we need easy and practical drawings to represent words.
